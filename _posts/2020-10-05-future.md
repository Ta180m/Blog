Unfortunately, one of the recurring themes of this blog has been missed deadlines. I'm always saying, I'm going to finish this new post by this day, but when the day comes, it's almost always been pushed back. And I've concluded that the main reason is my goal for the quality of this blog is too high.

Why is this a problem? Isn't high quality a good thing? Well yes, but it's also much more time-consuming. I can draft a fast, low-quality post in a few minutes, but to get it to the quality that I want, it can take up to an hour. Juggling all the other stuff that I do, I just don't have time except for quick, low-quality posts like this one. After all, it's not like people are actually going to read this, so the quality really doesn't matter. This is more of a place that I can jot down my ideas.
