[The hype is real!](https://copilot.github.com/)

Not only can Copilot write code, it can also talk with you in a text file. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to work with the open source build of Visual Studio Code, so I hopped into my Ubuntu VM and installed the proprietary VSCode build. Anyways, Copilot said some pretty... questionable things...
