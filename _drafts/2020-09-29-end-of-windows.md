According to open-source advocate Eric S. Raymond, the end of Windows may be in sight. A few days ago, on his blog, he posted a [very thought-provoking article](http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=8764) about the future of Windows and Linux. After doing a little bit of further research, I've concluded that he does have a convincing argument:

 1. **Money** - What's Microsoft's biggest source of profit today? Hint: It's not Windows. These days, Azure is Microsoft's cash cow.


Maybe if I find some time, I'll write the rest up...
