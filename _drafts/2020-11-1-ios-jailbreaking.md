Let's do this "episode" style:


## Episode 0 (Because no true programmer would start a list with 1)

In fourth or fifth grade, a friend told me about all the cool things he was doing with his jailbroken iPhone.

This is EXACTLY like your friend telling you about how fun and awesome competitive programming is.

I wasn't impressed.


## Episode 1

Five years later...

After doing some TI-Nspire, Wii U, and Switch hacking, I set my eyes on my lowly iPhone 6s with a cracked screen that I'm procrastinating to fix. The time was ripe for some iOS jailbreaking!

Hacking a TI-Nspire, Wii U, or Switch involves going on GitHub and downloading some files. But for iOS jailbreaking, I was clueless on what to download, so I searched for "iPhone 6s 12.1.4 jailbreak".

DON'T DO THIS! You get a bunch of junk results like random YouTube videos, so I followed one and it was really sketchy. Like, extremely sketchy. I had to install a bunch of apps from the app store before the jailbreak could begin, and, well, it was sketchy.

Plus, it didn't work.

This is EXACTLY like a weird, sketchy greedy algorithm that you doubt is going to work, and you implement it, but... it doesn't work.


## Episode 2

Yeah, that didn't work. Let's try something else. So, I did some research, and found a different, actually legit jailbreak. But it was still sketchy, because I didn't know a thing about sideloading `.ipa`s, so I installed some kind of enterprise app thingy? DON'T DO THIS! You'll get pwned instantly, so yeah, don't install untrusted and sketchy apps.

But somehow, it worked!

This is EXACTLY like a weird, sketchy greedy algorithm that you doubt is going to work, and you implement it, but... it does work somehow.
