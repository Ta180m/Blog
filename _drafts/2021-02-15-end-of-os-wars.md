According to open-source advocate Eric S. Raymond, the end of Windows may be in sight. A few days ago, on his blog, he posted a [very thought-provoking article](http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=8764) about the future of Windows and Linux.





There are basically three possibilities for the future:

1. Linux overtakes and dominates Windows in market share, perhaps from Microsoft adopting the Linux kernel as what Raymond suggested.

2. Linux stays at around its current market share forever. It seems to me that the current situation isn't exactly a very stable equilibrium, but hey, Linux has been roughly in the same zone for at least 15 years, so maybe this could continue indefinitely.

3. Linux market share on the desktop asymptotically approaches zero and becomes a hobbyist OS (again). Unlikely, since there seems to be a pretty healthy community of people supporting it right now. MacOS has always been taking away a chunk of would-be Linux users, and since it's gaining market share, that could be a bad thing for Linux.

We're going to start with possibility 2, since it mirrors the present the closest. What's preventing Linux market share from increasing beyond the already-impressive 2-3%? Two things: preinstalled hardware and apps.

Manufacturers are definitely pumping out more Linux computers these days, with the big brands like Dell and Lenovo in the game now. Linux market share has also been slightly increasing, and this may be a possible contributor. Preinstalled hardware provides much more benefits than just the obvious now laypeople don't need to bother to do the installation themselves. But also, manufacturers are not going to sell you broken hardware that doesn't work with Linux; they're going to at least but the bare minimum effort the make sure it works decently. Maybe it won't be Windows-level (which is a pretty low bar to pass, since many OEM drivers are horrendous), but it'll be better than now, where hardware incompatibilities and issues still plague the Linux world. I have a friend who tried out Kubuntu, but guess what? His laptop and Kubuntu didn't really get along well, so, back to Windows 10!

What about apps? The state of Linux apps has come a long way in the past few years, with the rise of distro-agnostic packages like Snap (the chaotic one), Flatpak (the lawful one), and AppImage (the neutral one), the ([evil](https://medium.com/@boundarybreaker/electron-is-a-hulking-monstrosity-of-a-wora-framework-and-it-needs-to-be-replaced-25e9d849b0e)) Electron framework, improvements in [Wine](https://www.winehq.org/announce/6.0) and virtualization, 

A final thought: Does market share even matter?
