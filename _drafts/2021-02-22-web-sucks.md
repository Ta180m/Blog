[suckless.org](https://suckless.org) really hates [the web](https://suckless.org/sucks/web/). I'll quote them directly:

> *It has enabled the global information exchange, mass surveillance, studies in social control, allowed revolutions, made a fortune for many billionaires and in the meanwhile ruined our climate: the web.*

> *There is an industry which is specialized on extending the resource usage to display just some characters on your display. Millions of jobs are based on outputting HTML in an inefficient way. Look at PHP and all the techniques to extend its "scalability". It is not scalable, it's a prototyping language. Not to mention all its syntactic irregularities. Nowadays classes on classes on classes with getter and setter functions define buttons which can be stripped down to just a simple character string. The web is the practical example why corporate software development does not work and never will. It only ruins our environment, sanity and many brains which could be used for the better of humanity.*

> *PHP was used as the primary example for how interpreted languages produce resource waste. There were optimisations for compiling PHP to C++(!). But this is just a way to allow the mass of programmer sheep to go on and sleep calm at night.*
