| Pro | Con |
| --- | --- |
| Minimal installer... | ...but it's confusing for beginners |
| Bleeding-edge software... | ...but less stable and more prone to breakages |
| Very complete software library with the Arch User Repository... | ...but anyone can add a package, so it can't always be trusted |
| Ultimate customizability... | ...but time-consuming as well |
| Teaches you tons about Linux... | ...even if you don't want to learn |
| Extremely helpful wiki... | ...but people always tell you to read the docs if you ask for help on a forum |
| Arch users are stereotyped as "l33t hax0rz"... | ...but also as "autistic middle-schoolers" |
